Discord Bot made with python for a private server. <br>

**Origin of the name:**

El Bandolero is the infamous racer who managed to beat a Porsche Turbo <br>
in is humble Nissan Maxima.

**How it works:**

The bot is hosted in repl it and uses UptimeRobot to keep running <br>
It is a general purpose bot. I basicly add features that I find interesting and usefull. <br> 
Includes commands to administer the server, get posts from reddit<br>
and to do some silly stuff. I also reacts to events on text channels.<br>

**Note:** some commands require admin role
